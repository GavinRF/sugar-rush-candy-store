  hitting our shelves next week.

We've tracked down a limited supply of some of the most requested retro candies from the 70s, 80s, and 90s. These treats will be available starting Tuesday, but quantities are limited so don't wait!

Our latest haul includes classics like Marathon Bars (now called Snickers in some countries), original recipe candy cigarettes, Astro Pops, and a variety of regional favorites that disappeared from store shelves decades ago.

## Why nostalgic candy matters

There's something magical about tasting a candy you haven't had since childhood. It's not just about the flavor - it's about the memories that come flooding back. That summer at your grandparents' house, the corner store after school, birthday parties with friends.

> The taste of a favorite childhood candy can transport you back in time more powerfully than any photograph.

We believe preserving these sweet traditions is important, which is why we work so hard to source discontinued and hard-to-find treats.

## What to expect

This collection includes candies from several eras:

- **1970s classics**: Wax bottles, candy buttons on paper, and Chuckles
- **1980s favorites**: Push Pops, Big League Chew, and Nerds in original packaging
- **1990s gems**: Squeezit-style candies, Bubble Jug, and Wonder Balls

Many of these items come from specialty suppliers who reproduce the original recipes, while others are genuine vintage stock from overseas markets where they're still produced.

Stop by early next week to grab your favorites before they're gone. We can't guarantee when we'll be able to get another shipment like this!
