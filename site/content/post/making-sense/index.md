Gummy bears are one of the most popular candies in the world, but few people know the story of how they came to be. Let's explore the sweet history behind these iconic treats.

## The birth of the gummy bear

In 1920, a German candy maker named Hans Riegel founded a small company in Bonn, Germany. He called it Haribo - a combination of his name (Hans Riegel) and his hometown (Bonn). Two years later, in 1922, he created the first gummy bears, inspired by the trained bears that were popular at festivals and street fairs across Europe.

The original gummy bears were larger than the ones we know today, and Riegel called them "Dancing Bears" (Tanzbären). They were an instant hit with German children and adults alike.

## How gummy bears are made

The gummy bear-making process involves several key ingredients and steps:

- Gelatin (or pectin for vegetarian versions)
- Sugar and glucose syrup
- Fruit flavors and colors
- Citric acid for that slight tang

The ingredients are heated, mixed, and poured into bear-shaped molds. After cooling and setting for several days, the bears are coated with a light wax to prevent them from sticking together.

## Gummy bears today

Today, gummy bears come in countless varieties - sour, giant-sized, organic, and even vitamin-infused. But the classic fruit-flavored bears remain the most popular. Haribo alone produces about 100 million gummy bears every single day!
