  - heading: Quality ingredients
    text: >
      Not all candy is created equal. We prioritize treats made with real
      ingredients - real chocolate, real fruit flavors, and time-tested recipes.
      We work with suppliers who share our commitment to quality, so every piece
      of candy we sell meets our high standards.

      Sugar Rush is proud to be part of the Bothell community. We believe a
      neighborhood candy store should be a gathering place where families make
      memories. We support local events and love seeing familiar faces come
      through our doors.

  - heading: Small batch makers
    text: >
      We partner with artisan candy makers who craft their sweets in small batches
      with care and attention. By supporting these independent confectioners, we
      bring you unique flavors and quality you won't find in mass-produced treats.

      Candy isn't just something you eat - it's an experience. Whether you're
      picking out a treat for yourself, building a gift box for someone special,
      or exploring new flavors from around the world, we're here to make every
      visit memorable and fun.
